Requirements are descriptions of the services that a software system must provide and the constraints under which it must operate. Knowing exactly what features and functionalities a customer wants in the application is quite challenging for a software development team. To avoid any misunderstandings, a customer and a software development team need to define project requirements. Requirements analysis is a very critical process that enables the success of a system or software project to be assessed. 
Requirements are generally split into two types:
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Functional Requirements are the reuirements that the end user specifically demands as basic facilities that the system should offer. All these functionalities need to be necessarily incorporated into the system. In other words Functional reuirements is what an application must or must no do after some data input. Functional requirements are important as they show software developers how the system is intended to behave. If the system doesn't meet functional requirements it means that it doesn't work properly.

## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-Functional reuirements determine the performance standards and quality attributes of software if an application doesn't meet non-functional requirements, it continues to perform its basic functions, however, it won't be able to provide a great user experience. Non-Functional Requirements are important for developing high-quality software..
They deal with issues like
- Usability : Defines how easy a user can interact with the app's interface. For example, a video conferencing app should have a simple, intuitive interface for easy navigation.

- Performance and Scalability : This refers to the speed at which the system can complete tasks and its ability to handle increased demand. For instance, an e-commerce website should be capable of accommodating many visitors during peak shopping seasons.
- security :  Relates to the system’s protection against unauthorized access. For example, an online banking system should have robust security measures to safeguard customers’ personal and financial information.
- Availability :This denotes how often the system is accessible. For example, an online shopping website should be available 24/7 to allow customers to shop anytime.
### why to differentiate between Functional and Non-Functional Requirements Important?

Well-defined functional and non-functional requirements helps software developers to build the product that exactly corresponds to the client's needs.
The main reason to know the difference between functional and non-functional requirements is that they define the scope of work for a project. Software developers need to keep up with this scope to develop an application within its timeframe and budget.

##  Difference Between Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements

| Functional Requirements | Non-Functional Requirements |
| ------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Specifies what should the software system do | It places constraints on "How should the software system fulfill the functional requirements?"|
| Functional requirements are specified by User| Non-Functional requirements are specified by technical peoples e.g software developers|
|It is mandatory | Better to have|
|Helps to verify the functionality of the software | Helps to verify the performance of the software|

## Example
Let's consider a case of developing a new online banking system for a financial institution. In this scenario we can identify both functional and non-functional requirements.
#### Functional Requirements
- user should be able to register and login securely.
- user should be able to open close and manage different types of accounts.
- system should allow users to view their account balance and transaction history.
- user should be able to transfer funds.
- fund transfer confirmation and notification.
#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Security : Implement robust encryption protocol for data transmission.
- Performance : Response time for critical function (login and fund transfer) should be less than 2 sec.
- Usability : The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- Scalability : The system should be scalable to accomodate growing user base.
